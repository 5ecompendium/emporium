## To Do
* Create another layout for the spell level tag pages (e.g. cantrip, level1). Also figure out what to do with those pages.
* Find a real home for class specializations (e.g. cleric's domains)
* Clean up header and navigation scheme.
* Figure out mobile styles for tables. Also /fistshake at whoever decided tables in spell lists were a good idea.

## Structure
Spells can be found inside `_posts/`. Each spell gets its own post, written and stored as a [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) file. The date is arbitrary and never displayed, but still necessary for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to process the posts properly.

If you'd like to help fill out the rest of the spells from the PHB, for each new spell you make:

1. Make a new post inside `_posts/` for each new spell, and copy the formatting from another spell.
2. Submit a pull request for the spell(s) when you're finished, and that's it! Thank you so much. :)

## Build Instructions
I've edited _config.yml for my own build purposes, but if you've got [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) set up locally, the following should create the build from your friendly command line terminal:
`jekyll serve -Vw --no-watch --baseurl ""`

## Thanks

Cleric and wizard spells from the Starter Kit were seeded from [this Reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2a7wau/5e_cleric_and_wizard_spells_sorted_by_level/).

Thanks to @sethxd for suggesting [Jets.js](http://nexts.github.io/Jets.js/), a CSS search engine that plays nicely with Jekyll.
