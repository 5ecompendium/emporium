# Grimoire

Grimoire is a mobile-friendly 5e spellbook that organizes spell lists by class and level.

See the latest compiled build here: [http://ephe.github.io/grimoire/](http://ephe.github.io/grimoire/)

## Changelog
* Added Wizard cantrips and level 1 from the starter kit.
* Added all Cleric cantrips and level 1 spells.

## To Do
* Create another layout for the spell level tag pages (e.g. cantrip, level1). Also figure out what to do with those pages.
* Clean up header and navigation scheme.
* Style all the things!
* Finish adding spells, obviously.

## Structure
Spells can be found inside _posts/. Each spell gets its own post, written and stored as a [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) file. The date is arbitrary and never displayed, but still necessary for [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) to process the posts properly.

If you'd like to help fill out the rest of the spells from the PHB, make a new post in _posts/ for each new spell, and copy the formatting from another spell.  Submit a pull request for the spell(s) when you're finished, and that's it! Thank you so much. :)

## Thanks

Cleric and wizard spells from the Starter Kit were seeded from [this Reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2a7wau/5e_cleric_and_wizard_spells_sorted_by_level/).
