**4th Abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour

This spell turns the flesh of a willing creature you touch as hard as stone. Until the spell ends, the target has resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
