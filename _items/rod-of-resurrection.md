The rod has 5 charges. While you hold it, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: _heal_ (expends 1 charge) or _resurrection_ (expends 5 charges).

The rod regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If the rod is reduced to 0 charges, roll a d20. On a 1, the rod disappears in a burst of radiance.
