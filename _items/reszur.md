You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which doesn't make noise when it hits or cuts something.

The name "_Reszur_" is graven on the dagger's pommel. If the wielder speaks the name, the blade gives off a faint, cold glow, shedding dim light in a 10-foot radius until the wielder speaks the name again.
