**Wondrous Item**  
*Very rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this belt, your Strength score changes to 23. If your Strength is already equal to or greater than the beltâ€™s score, the item has no effect on you. Six varieties of this belt exist, corresponding with and having rarity according to the six kinds of true giants. The *belt of stone giant strength* and the *belt of frost giant strength* look different, but they have the same effect.
